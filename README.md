# Hello-World
OH YES IM STARTING PROGRAMMING

I love learning new things but certain things dont click with me so meh
Ever since i knew how much apps make these days i would love trying this out
it's not just because of the money but also because of the passion i want to have when creating apps so that i'm not forcing myself onto this just because of money.
i need to enjoy it too you know
